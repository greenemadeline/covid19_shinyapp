# Final Assignment BIOL01301 (data science class)

### Part One: Prepare the data in `covid_data_load.R`

You will read in three files (two from JHU and one from NYT) and ultimately produce *two TIDY tibbles* for use in the shiny app. Bear in mind: All data here is *cumulative* (the total number of cases or deaths up to and including that day!).


### Part Two: Make a shiny application!

All data is from the New York times and John Hopkins University

2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
